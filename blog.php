    <h1 style="color: aliceblue;" >How to recognize a <br> counterfeit watch?</h1>
    <p style="color: aliceblue;">As is often the case with luxury products, branded watches are frequently <br> counterfeited. Therefore, if you buy a second-hand watch or from an <br> unauthorized store, you run the risk of ending up with a counterfeit on your hands. <br> Here are some tips for spotting counterfeits and differentiating them from <br> authentic pieces.</p>

    
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h1 style="color: aliceblue;">Inscriptions and engravings</h1>
    <p style="color: aliceblue;">The first thing to check to know if you are dealing with a counterfeit watch is the <br> engravings and inscriptions it bears. Brand watches all have recognizable <br> distinctive signs.
        <br>
        <br>

        If you notice spelling mistakes in the inscriptions on the dial or on the back of the <br> watch, run away. If the font used for the inscriptions is different from that usually <br> used by the brand, it is probably a counterfeit watch.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Also be aware that some watch brands have introduced special markings, such as <br> a small laser engraving on the glass.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1 style="color: aliceblue;">Identifiers and serial numbers</h1>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">Each branded watch carries a unique identifier or serial number. <br> Manufacturers provide websites where customers can enter the serial number and get model <br> information. If the serial number cannot be found, or if it does not match the <br> watch model or year of manufacture, it is likely a counterfeit watch.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h1 style="color: aliceblue;">Defect detection</h1>
        <p style="float: left; color:black;">Even though counterfeits improve every year, they are far from equal to original <br> watches. To identify a counterfeit watch, you can look at the finishing details. If <br> you see burrs, abnormal scratches on the dial or bracelet, if the latter is loosely <br> attached or if the hands have suspicious movement, you can legitimately think <br> that you are holding a counterfeit in your hands.
            <br>
            <br>

            In any case, the best way to avoid buying a counterfeit is to contact approved <br> sellers.
